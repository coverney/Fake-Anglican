# Fake-Anglican
 For our Programming Languages final project, we built our own functional
 programming language with a Scheme-like syntax. Our programming language
 consists of an interactive shell, an s-expression parser, various Expression
 classes making up the source code, and multiple run time representation Value classes.

 The programming language is called Fake Anglican because it is based off of Anglican,
 a probabilistic programming language. More information about our project can be found [here](Probabilistic_Programming_Slides.pdf). If you have any questions, please
 email coverney@olin.edu or vchen@olin.edu.
